##Campbell Ratings

For a long time, I have had the idea that, if you take the number of factors that a number has, and divide it by the number itself, you get a sort of "rating."

But I quickly realised that this doesn't really work. Smaller numbers like 1 and 2 have the largest ratings because they are so small.

However, one night, I was thinking, and I realised that if you square the number of factors things get a lot more interesting:

The number 6 has 4 factors. Squared is 16. Divided by 6 is 2.667. 
However, 12 has 6 factors. Squared is 36. Divided by 12 is 3.

With pen and paper I realised that I myself couldn't find any numbers that had a rating higher than 3, so i made a program that checked them.

The program showed there were indeed no numbers up to 100,000,000 with a rating higher than 3. (I didn't go any higher because I'd proved my point and 100,000,000 took 3 and a half hours). 

I am now thinking about how all this relates to the quick method of finding how many factors a number has,(http://www.wikihow.com/Find-How-Many-Factors-Are-in-a-Number) and how changing the power of the factor affects the results and the highest rating.
